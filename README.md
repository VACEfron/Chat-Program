# Chat Program
ðŸ’¬ A server to connect clients and send chat messages as network practice.

## Introduction
This project contains a server and client program as network practice for me using `TcpListener` and `TcpClient`.

## Known Issues
 - The `ReadMessagesAsync` method in the Server project is often not executed properly when clients send messages, so some messages are not being sent.
